# NodeJS-npm-task

## Task
Implement app that contains at least one dependency and one dev dependency.

## Description
I created my first Node.js server, wich makes an URL-request, gets the data, converts it into single words, and styles them. I used [**express**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [**request**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) and [**randomcolor**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/randomcolor) dependencies.

## Usage
To view the app you need to clone this repo, then to install dependencies and run the server:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bespacefor/NodeJS-npm-task
    $ npm install
    $ npm test
